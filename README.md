On this site you can see character information related to the Dark Souls 2 game and songs I made related to the characters. The home page has some general information and after that you can change the page from the navigation to the character page where by clicking on the character you enlarge the div to read more where there is also a button that you can press to get to the page corresponding to the character to read more information about the character (the character information is prompted by AI so it is not completely correct but it is approximate. The character Raime is the only one with 100% accurate information because I got it myself from the internet when chatGPT didn't want to work and the character Sir Alonne is also the one I paid more attention to, to me more exact it has more details in the theory section.). Then there is the song page where I collected all the songs that appear on the character pages and a few extra songs.
